Hello! I'm starting a new session for {project_name}.

The task file `{task_file_path}` contains:

--- BEGIN TASK FILE ---
{task_file_content}
--- END TASK FILE ---

If it's empty or just contains the title, we can start fresh.
Otherwise, let's continue from where we left off.
On what should we start working on?
